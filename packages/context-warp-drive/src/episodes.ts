/**
 * context-warp/episodes — durable episodic recall.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   1. The turnkey PORTABLE store (flat exports below): derive sealed episodes
 *      from a message window, persist them, and page path-triggered recall cards
 *      back in — with a one-call SQLite reference store (`createEpisodeStore`,
 *      optional `better-sqlite3` peer). Start here.
 *   2. The relay's RICH episodic engine (namespaced `richEpisodes`,
 *      `richEpisodeCapture`, `episodePathCanon`): chain cards with chapters /
 *      Δ-lines / bookends, narration mining, the boundary-injection state
 *      machine, epoch-seam capture, and canonical path identity. Bring your own
 *      store (see docs/architecture.md). Namespaced to avoid type-name
 *      collisions (both layers define `EpisodeMember`).
