/**
 * Reference SQLite episode store for context-warp.
 *
 * A one-call factory that opens a local SQLite database (via the OPTIONAL
 * `better-sqlite3` peer dependency) and creates the episodic spine schema —
 * `sessions`, `episodes`, `episode_members` — that `episodeStore.ts`'s
 * `recordEpisodes` / `recallEpisodeCards` operate on.
 *
 * This is a single-agent reference implementation. The relay's production store
 * (`relay/src/workerPool/handlers/foldEpisodes.ts`) additionally layers
 * multi-agent lineage scoping, silo quarantine, workspace-root scoping, jaccard
 * chapter coalescing, and chainScore ranking — documented as the production
 * extension. For a single agent, recency-ordered path-keyed recall is enough.
 *
 * `better-sqlite3` is the only piece of the episodic layer that needs a native
 * module; the derivation + recall logic in `episodeStore.ts` is dependency-free,
 * so you can also implement `EpisodeDatabase` against any other SQLite binding.
 */
