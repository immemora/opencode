/**
 * foldEpisodes.ts — Episodic continuity engine, pure core.
 *
 * An episode is the durable memory of one work burst: which files were touched
 * together (the blast radius / activation zone), in what order (the
 * structural-verbatim branch trace), and what the agent itself said at the time
 * (voice annotations mined verbatim from atlas_commit / tap_star / typed chat,
 * plus tier-B narration distilled deterministically from burst-final
 * assistant prose — see extractNarrationLines).
 * Episodes are derived at fold-epoch boundaries, persisted by the worker pool
 * (fold-episodes.sqlite), and recalled as chain cards when any member of a zone
 * is touched again. Trigger semantics are zone-based, never lock-and-key:
 * touching ONE member recalls the WHOLE zone.
 *
 * INVARIANTS
 * - Pure CPU island: zero I/O, zero imports, zero ambient reads (no Date.now,
 *   no randomness). Same inputs → byte-identical output. Safe to import from
 *   worker handlers, capture seams, backfill scripts, and replay studies alike.
 * - NO-NARRATOR RULE: traces and cards contain only structural tokens (tools,
 *   targets, outcomes, order, counts) plus VERBATIM agent-authored text.
 *   Nothing retrospective, nothing paraphrased, no voice that wasn't there.
 *   Truncation of verbatim text (with a trailing ellipsis) is permitted;
 *   rewording is not. Narration annotations stay inside this rule: they are
 *   the agent's own contemporaneous words, selected by a deterministic shape
 *   gate (never an LLM), provenance-marked as kind 'narration' (🗣), and
 *   ranked below every deliberate voice channel unless promoted by a declared
 *   SOP register glyph (🏁/⚠️).
 *   The only derived line is the episode summary header,
 *   built from the agent's own changelog/rail words first, structural facts
 *   (top member paths) as the last fallback.
 * - Gradient law: the hot chapter renders full (members + trace + voice +
 *   since-then deltas), warm chapters render one-liners, cold chapters collapse
 *   to a single line. The same compression law applies at every chain level.
 * - Episodes must outlive their source transcripts: persist `trace` and
 *   `annotations` denormalized at write time (aa-ledger ENOENT lesson).
 *   Nothing in this module reaches back to transcript files at render time.
