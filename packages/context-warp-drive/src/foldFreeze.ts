/**
 * Fold Freeze — cache-aware gating for the rolling-fold compaction pipeline.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM: provider prompt caches (Anthropic explicit `cache_control`
 * breakpoints, OpenAI/Gemini automatic prefix caching) bill cached prefix
 * reads at ~0.1x input price and cache writes at ~1.25x. They match on
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL prefixes. The always-on rolling fold recomputes the folded
 * view on every API call: each new turn entering the fold shifts the
 * newest-first assistant-text budget, re-collapses sequences, and re-renders
 * the synthetic fold block at the head of the messages array — so the message
 * region's bytes change on every call and the provider cache dies at the
 * start of history. Under a hot cache, continuous folding *costs more than it
 * saves*: you re-write the folded region at 1.25x every turn instead of
 * reading stable history at 0.1x. (Break-even needs >92% compression — past
 * the practical fold floor once the assistant-text budget is full.)
 *
 * THE FIX: freeze the compaction pipeline's output and reuse it byte-identical
 * while the provider cache is plausibly alive; append new raw messages after
 * it. Pure append = pure prefix-cache hits (the previous call's rolling
 * breakpoint covers the entire frozen view). Recompute (an "epoch") only when
 * mutation is free or necessary:
 *
 *   - `cold-gap`: time since the last call exceeded the provider cache TTL —
 *     the cache entry already expired, so a full refold costs nothing extra.
 *     Anthropic's ephemeral cache TTL is a sliding 5 minutes (refreshed on
 *     every hit); OpenAI's automatic cache evicts after ~5-10 idle minutes.
 *     Human-paced turn gaps are very often cold, which is where the fold's
 *     full savings land for free.
 *   - `tail-epoch`: the raw overhang appended since the freeze exceeded
 *     `maxTailChars` — pay one bounded cache rewrite (at folded size) to
 *     reclaim fold savings before the context bloats. This is the context
 *     guard for marathon hot streaks.
 *   - `context-changed`: the thinning mode changed, or a file claim appeared
 *     on a path that is actually RELEVANT to the frozen coverage. Claimed
 *     paths must unfold promptly (the fold's claimed-path auto-unfold rule) —
 *     but that rule keys off tool-arg paths (`isClaimedPath(info.path)`), so
 *     a claim can only change the fold's output when its normalized path
 *     matches a tool path present in the covered raw history. Claims on paths
 *     this session never touched — the dominant cross-agent case under the
 *     GLOBAL claims set, where every claim by any agent used to epoch every
 *     fold-on session fleet-wide — reuse safely. Releases of relevant claims
 *     also reuse: the affected content stays unfolded (correct, just briefly
 *     unoptimized) until the next natural epoch re-folds it.
 *   - `history-rewound` / `boundary-mismatch`: the raw history no longer
 *     extends the frozen coverage (rebirth artifacts, truncation, in-place
 *     rewrites). Self-healing: recompute from current raw truth.
 *
 * Net effect: the fold's quality machinery (graduated assistant-text budget,
 * sequence collapsing, claimed-path unfolds, atlas-metadata preservation) is
 * untouched — it simply fires in PULSES at epoch boundaries instead of on
 * every call. Between pulses the request stream is append-only and the
 * provider cache stays hot. A pleasant side effect: recent turns stay
 * verbatim throughout a hot streak (the fold boundary doesn't advance), which
 * softens the activeWindowTurns=1 "big result last turn" trade-off most of
 * the time.
 *
 * Engine-agnostic: lives at the `applyCompaction` seam in FcBaseSession, so
 * claude-api, OpenAI, Gemini, GLM, Grok, Mistral, and MiniMax all inherit it.
 * Pure CPU, zero I/O, no timers — event-loop safe by construction. State
 * lives on the session object and resets naturally on rebirth.
 *
 * Kill switch: VOXXO_FOLD_FREEZE=0 reverts to per-call recompute (the
 * pre-freeze always-on behavior). TTL and tail cap are env-tunable; callers may
 * also provide model-aware defaults so the hot-tail sawtooth tracks the fold
 * target band unless explicitly overridden.

  // current raw history and reuse the predecessor's frozen prefix bytes. This
  // is the mechanism that lets the cache survive the rebirth boundary.
