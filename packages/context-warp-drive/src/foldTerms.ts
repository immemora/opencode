/**
 * Fold Terms — tier-2 distinctive-term extraction + IDF-weighted cross-reference.
 *
 * The deferred "tier-2" of episodic recall (see foldRecall.ts ~L516-517, which
 * names term extraction as "deliberately absent in v1"). Where the existing path
 * tiers self-index WORK (the files a burst touched), this self-indexes THOUGHT —
 * pathless cognition — by its own coined vocabulary. It is pure set-intersection
 * + IDF weighting over a BOUNDED candidate set (sealed episodes / categorized
 * stars): the SAME class of operation as the path tiers, and deliberately NOT the
 * boundary corpus-search that was kill-switched in contextRebirthTool.ts
 * (L160 "Kill-switch for the rebirth-package auto-RAG injection lane" / L177
 * "auto-RAG has been injecting low-signal / noisy chunks ... contaminating
 * successor continuity"). Cross-reference is a Set and a loop; search is a model
 * and a corpus. This file is the former and must never become the latter.
 *
 * ── FENCE (load-bearing invariant — enforced by foldTermsFence.test.ts) ──
 * This module imports ONLY the pure `tokenize` helper from sparseVector.ts. It
 * MUST NOT import denseHybridRetrieval / embedStore / chunkStore / sqlite-vec /
 * HNSW or any embedding/inverted-index machinery. Crossing that line re-creates
 * the low-signal noise that got auto-RAG kill-switched.
 *
 * ── Distinctiveness model ──
 * Corpus-common JARGON (e.g. "context", "fold", "system" in this repo) is
 * suppressed by IDF at MATCH time, NOT by a static word list — a hardcoded jargon
 * list would be brittle and workspace-specific. The static stopword sets below
 * remove only GRAMMAR: generic grammatical English (STOPWORDS) and the reserved
 * keywords of programming languages (CODE_STOPWORDS). Rarity does the real work
 * for content words, and it is corpus-relative, so it self-tunes per workspace.
 *
 * ── Why CODE_STOPWORDS exists (and is NOT the jargon list the header forbids) ──
 * IDF provably CANNOT suppress programming keywords on a code-mixed corpus. A
 * keyword like `import` is corpus-RARE (most episodes are non-code), so its IDF is
 * HIGH — measured 2026-06-17 on the live store, `import` (df=36) scored a HIGHER
 * IDF than the genuinely coined term `rebirth` (df=103). Yet `import`/`let`/`const`
 * carry zero topical signal: they are the grammatical FUNCTION WORDS of code, the
 * exact analogue of English "the"/"of". They flooded term-tier recall because
 * every code-working agent's active window contains them, matching every stored
 * code episode. Reserved keywords are a CLOSED, universal, language-level set —
 * not workspace topic jargon — so filtering them is the same category as the
 * English stopword list, not the brittle domain list the header warns against.

/**
 * Light suffix-stripping stemmer. Collapses inflectional variants so that
 * fold/folded/folding/folds share one canonical stem. Pure string ops — no
 * imports, no model, no corpus lookup — so it respects the FENCE.
 *
 * Strategy: strip common English inflectional suffixes in order from longest
 * to shortest, with a minimum stem length guard (MIN_STEM_LEN) to prevent
 * over-stemming short words (e.g. "is" → "" or "files" → "fi"). Words shorter
 * than the shortest suffix are returned unchanged.
 *
 * This is intentionally NOT a full Porter/Snowball stemmer — those are heavier
 * and would require either a dependency (breaking the fence) or ~200 lines of
 * hand-written rules. This ~30-line function catches 80%+ of the morphological
 * fragmentation quantified in the live store (866 stems with 2+ variants,
 * 2,183 terms split across inflections — rail-2d53647f).
 *
 * Suffixes are ordered longest-first so that multi-suffix words like
 * "rationalization" strip "-ization" before "-ation" would fire.
