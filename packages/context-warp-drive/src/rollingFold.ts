 *     still uses activeWindowTurns as its trigger hysteresis.

 *     and never mutates the raw JSONL, so any folded turn is one self-tap away.

// session, so the standing fold block grows monotonically. Eviction bounds it:
// at full-recompute freeze EPOCH commits only (the prefix is recomputing anyway
// — cache-safe by construction), the OLDEST folded spans collapse to tombstone
// lines. Relay/FoldSession callers pass a target frontier so every full
// recompute attempts eviction; direct foldContext callers without a target keep
// the legacy char-threshold sawtooth. Eligibility is the session's call
// (fcBaseSession.buildFoldEvictionInput): a turn is evictable only when its
// content is durably covered by the episodic store (the capture cursor advances
// past episode-bearing ranges only after the store CONFIRMS the write) AND it
// has been folded for ≥2 epochs. Evicted content is not gone: episodic recall
// serves it as cards on member-path touch, and fold-recall still pages the raw
// turns back transiently — the block header count includes evicted turns on
// purpose so buildFoldIndex keeps indexing them.
